# human_activity_recognition
This project is essentially a simplification and fork of Guillaume Chevalier's work
Guillaume Chevalier, LSTMs for Human Activity Recognition, 2016, https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition
I've adopted the project and created a dataset of my own for the LSTM with a different and updated architecture.
I've been able to push the accuracy to 95-96%, but can't realease the code, due to copyright from work. If you would like to implement a project similar or have questions please let me know at matt@tractionhealth.com and I can try and help.
